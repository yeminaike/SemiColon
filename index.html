				<p>.. amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all 
				persons.</p>
				<br/>
				<p> ..clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.</P>
				<br/>
				<p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there wil
				l be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
				</P>
				<br/>
				<p>Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for
				high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the 
				grass.</P>
				<br/>
				<p>Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</P>
				<br/>
				<p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and 
				loneliness.</P>
				<br/>
				<p>Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. 
				And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, 
				it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</P>

			<section>
				<p>Figure it out for yourself, my lad,You've all that the greatest of men have had,
				Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,
				And a brain to use if you would be wise.With this equipment they all began,
				So start for the top and say "I can."</p>
				<br/>

				<p>Look them over, the wise and great,
				They take their food from a common plate
				And similar knives and forks they use,
				With similar laces they tie their shoes,
				The world considers them brave and smart.
				But you've all they had when they made their start.</p>
				<br/>

				<p>You can triumph and come to skill, You can be great if only you will,
				You're well equipped for what fight you choose,
				You have legs and arms and a brain to use,
				And the man who has risen, great deeds to do
				Began his life with no more than you.</p>
				<br/>

				<p>You are the handicap you must face,
				You are the one who must choose your place,
				You must say where you want to go.
				How much you will study the truth to know,
				God has equipped you for life, But He
				Lets you decide what you want to be.</p>
				<br/>

				<p>Courage must come from the soul within,
				The man must furnish the will to win,
				So figure it out for yourself, my lad,
				You were born with all that the great have had,
				With your equipment they all began.
				Get hold of yourself, and say: "I can."</p>
